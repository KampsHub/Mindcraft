# Mindcraft — Todo & Action Tracker
**Last updated:** April 5, 2026

## YOUR ACTION ITEMS (Stefanie)

### Stefanie: Do These Before Launch

**1. Stripe — Verify live keys (2 min)**
Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables. Check these two:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — must start with `sk_live_`. If it starts with `sk_test_`, you're in test mode and real payments won't work. Get the live key from Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — must match the webhook endpoint configured for your live Stripe account (not the test one). Check Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → your endpoint → Signing secret.

**2. Sentry — Activate error monitoring (5 min)**
Go to sentry.io → your Mindcraft project → Settings → Client Keys (DSN). Copy the DSN string. Then:
- Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables → Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` with the DSN value
- Push any change (or empty commit) to trigger a redeploy
- After deploy, go to sentry.io — you should see a "first event" confirmation. From then on, production errors show up automatically.

**3. Cron secret — Enable scheduled emails (2 min)**
Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables. Check if `CRON_SECRET` exists.
- If missing: add it with any random string (e.g., go to randomkeygen.com, copy a 256-bit key)
- This secures the daily inactive-reminder and re-engage email cron jobs. Without it, the crons run but accept any request — a minor security gap.

**4. Run streak migration (1 min)**
Go to Supabase → SQL Editor → paste contents of `supabase/add-streak-columns.sql` → Run. Adds `current_streak`, `best_streak`, `last_completed_date` to `program_enrollments`.

**5. SQL scripts — Check if these were run (5 min)**
Go to Supabase → SQL Editor. For each script, you can check if it was already applied:
- `scripts/add-retrieval-exercises.sql` — Check: run `SELECT count(*) FROM exercises WHERE name LIKE '%Retrieval%'`. If 0, run the script.
- `scripts/update-scaffolding-notes.sql` — Check: run `SELECT scaffolding_note FROM day_content WHERE day_number = 15 LIMIT 1`. If null, run the script.
- `scripts/add-bloom-labels.sql` — Check: run `SELECT bloom_level FROM exercises LIMIT 1`. If column doesn't exist or is null, run the script.

**5. GA4 funnel (30 min)**
Go to GA4 → Explore → Create new Exploration → Funnel.
Steps: `page_view (/)` → `homescreen_program_click` → `begin_checkout` → `login_success` → `day_completed (day 1)` → `day_completed (day 7)`

### Stefanie: Co-Creation Decisions Needed

These are questions you raised that need your input before we can build:

**Coach Dashboard (#5) — What should coaches see?**
You said: logins, program progress, shared insights, coaching goals, enneagram. Before I build the UI:
- [ ] Should coaches see ALL clients, or only clients who explicitly shared with them (via the existing coach-sharing flow)?
- [ ] Should coaches be able to leave notes from this dashboard (currently only via a separate flow)?
- [ ] Do you want a "flag for follow-up" button on individual clients?

**User-Facing Analytics (#8) — What metrics matter to users?**
You asked what to surface on the Insights page. My suggestion:
- Weekly mood/rating trend (from `day_rating` — already tracked)
- Exercise completion count + streak
- Top patterns detected (from `step_3_analysis` themes)
- "Shifts" — moments where the AI noticed a change in tone, language, or theme
- [ ] Does this feel right, or do you want different metrics? Should any of these be visible to coaches too?

**Notification Preferences (#9) — Which emails should be toggleable?**
You said: build opt-in in account section. Proposed toggles:
- Inactive reminders (the 2-day nudges)
- Weekly insights email (doesn't exist yet — would be a new email)
- Program updates / new features
- [ ] Are these the right categories? Should "exit survey" also be opt-out-able, or always send?

**Search (#10) — How deep should search go?**
You asked how to make this possible. Two levels:
- **Simple (1 day):** Search bar on the journal page. Full-text search over `free_flow_entries.content`. Returns matching entries with highlighted snippets.
- **Deep (3 days):** Search across journals + exercises + insights. Unified search page with filters (date range, type, keyword). Could also search exercise responses.
- [ ] Which level do you want first?

**Streak Persistence (#11)**
No decision needed — I can just build this. Will add `current_streak` and `longest_streak` to enrollments and surface on dashboard.

**Token Cost Tracking (Monitoring)**
The admin dashboard at `/admin` already shows token costs by endpoint. Want me to also build a weekly cost summary email sent to `crew@allmindsondeck.com`? Or is checking the dashboard enough?
- [ ] Dashboard only, or also a weekly email?

### Railway Fix ✅ CODE FIX PUSHED
- The crash was `llm.LLMOptions` not existing in the installed livekit-agents version — **fixed in code** (removed type reference)
- Check Railway logs after next deploy to confirm it starts cleanly
- If still crashing: also set "Watch paths" to `livekit-agent/**` in Railway dashboard → Settings

### Lawyer Review (send these docs)
- **`LEGAL-HANGUPS.md`** — 36 specific legal risks across privacy policy + terms, with suggested draft language for arbitration, data retention, warranty disclaimer. Top 10 actions at the bottom.
- **`GDPR-RIGHTS-IMPLEMENTATION.md`** — Maps all 7 GDPR rights to product, identifies gaps, prioritizes what to build.
- Priority items for lawyer: arbitration clause, WA My Health My Data Act, GDPR legal basis, warranty disclaimer, IP address claim verification.

## To Dos

### CRITICAL — Blocks Launch

1. **Stripe keys** — The keys connected to the current mindcraft.ing products should be live keys. Verify in Vercel env vars that `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are live (not `sk_test_`).

2. ~~**Inactive user reminder emails**~~ — ✅ Done. 2-day threshold, max 3 reminders, exit survey after 3rd + 7 days. Cron scheduled. SQL run.

3. ~~**Subscription lifecycle**~~ — ✅ Not needed. Not officially a subscription.

### HIGH — Needed for Quality Launch

4. **Error monitoring (Sentry)** — Sentry is set up. Activate by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` in Vercel env vars. Verify errors appear in Sentry dashboard after deploy.

5. **Coach dashboard UI redesign** — API exists (`/api/coach-analytics`), page exists (`/coach`). Needs new UI showing:
   - Individual client logins and last-active dates
   - Where each client is in the program (current day, week)
   - Insights the client chooses to share
   - Coaching goals per client
   - Enneagram results (if client uploads)

6. ~~**Referral dashboard**~~ — Parked.

7. ~~**Admin panel**~~ — Accepted. Stefanie will use Supabase directly.

### Monitoring Features

| Feature | Needs | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Sentry | DSN env var in Vercel | Config ready — activate |
| ~~Quality monitoring cron~~ | ~~Vercel Cron job setup~~ | ✅ Already scheduled in vercel.json: `0 16 * * 1` (Monday 4 PM UTC) |
| Token cost tracking | Admin query on `api_logs` | Table exists — build query and send to Stefanie |

### Known Technical Debt

8. **In-memory rate limiting** — Current rate limiting uses in-memory counters. On Vercel, each request can hit a different serverless instance, so counters don't share state. At scale (100+ concurrent users), limits won't be enforced consistently. **Fix:** Add Redis (e.g., Upstash) as a shared counter store. ~2 hours of work.

9. ~~**API logs write synchronously**~~ — ✅ Done. Removed `await` from `logApiCall()` calls so responses return immediately. Logs still write in the background.

10. **Memory embeddings retrieval may slow** — As the `coaching_memories` table grows, similarity search queries will slow down. **Fix:** Add a PostgreSQL vector index (pgvector `ivfflat` or `hnsw` index), or limit retrieval to recent memories (last 90 days). Monitor query times in `api_logs` latency.

11. **No unit/integration tests** — Only manual `TEST-PLAN.md`. **To start:** Set up Vitest (fast, Vite-native) for unit tests + Playwright for integration tests. Start with: API route tests (process-journal, daily-exercise) and critical UI flows (login → dashboard → day 1). ~1 day for setup + first 10 tests.

12. ~~**283 exercises old format**~~ — ✅ Verified. Exercise data lives in database (not `exerciseDataCore.ts` which doesn't exist). 14 references to `whyNow`/`science` remain in rendering code as backward-compatible fallbacks — not a blocker.

13. **Email templates hardcoded** — All email HTML is inline in route handlers. **Fix:** Use React Email (`@react-email/components`) to build reusable templates as React components. Resend supports React Email natively. Create a `src/emails/` directory with shared layout + per-email templates. ~1 day to migrate existing emails.

### Data Storage Map — New Features (April 4, 2026)

All of these are tracked automatically — no action needed from Stefanie. To retrieve data:
- **Supabase tables** (`exercise_completions`, `weekly_reviews`, `program_enrollments`): Go to Supabase → Table Editor → select table → filter/export
- **Google Analytics events**: GA4 → Reports → Events → filter by event name
- **Sentry**: sentry.io dashboard (after activation)

| Feature | Where Stored | Column/Field | Type |
|---------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Star rating per exercise | `exercise_completions` | `star_rating` | integer 1-5 |
| Exercise feedback (≤3 stars) | `exercise_completions` | `feedback` | text |
| NPS score | `weekly_reviews` | `nps_score` | integer 0-10 |
| NPS score (backup) | Google Analytics | event `nps_submitted` | GA event |
| Day completed event | Google Analytics | event `day_completed` | GA event |
| Login success event | Google Analytics | event `login_success` | GA event |
| Cookie consent | `localStorage` | key `cookie-consent` | client-side |
| Pause/resume status | `program_enrollments` | `status` | enum |
| Exercise dedup window | `exercise_completions` | `completed_at >= 7 days ago` | query filter |
| Sentry errors | Sentry.io | requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | external |
| Staging deploys | Vercel | `develop` branch → preview URLs | infra |

### Quick Fixes


### MEDIUM — Important for Retention

8. **User-facing analytics** — Users see no progress metrics beyond day count. Suggestion: Surface on the Insights page — patterns detected over time, exercise completion rate, mood/rating trends, most-used frameworks, streak data. Could use recharts (already installed) to show week-over-week shifts.

9. **Notification preferences** — Users can't control email frequency. Build an email opt-in UI in the `/my-account` page with toggles for: inactive reminders, daily reminders, weekly insights, program updates. Store preferences in `clients` table (new `email_preferences` jsonb column).

10. **Search past entries** — Can't search journal entries or exercises. Suggestion: Add a search page or search bar on the journal/exercises pages. Use Supabase full-text search (`to_tsvector` + `to_tsquery`) on `free_flow_entries.content` and `exercise_completions.responses`. No external search service needed at current scale.

11. ~~**Streak persistence**~~ — ✅ Done. `current_streak`, `best_streak`, `last_completed_date` columns added. Streak updates on day completion. Shows on dashboard when streak ≥ 2. **Stefanie action:** Run `supabase/add-streak-columns.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.

### LOW — Nice to Have

12. **Dark/light mode toggle** — Currently dark-only. Adding light mode would require creating a second set of color tokens in `src/lib/theme.ts` and wrapping the app in a theme context. The current `colors.bgDeep`, `colors.textPrimary`, etc. are hardcoded to dark values throughout 50+ files. **Effort:** ~2-3 days. No issues for current dark mode — it would be additive, not a rewrite. The toggle would sit in `/my-account` and store preference in localStorage.

13. **Calendar view** — Month-level view of program progress. Build into the Plan & Progress page (`/goals`). Show a 30-day grid with completed days filled, current day highlighted, and streaks visible. Pull from `daily_sessions` + `program_enrollments.current_day`. **Effort:** ~4-6 hours.

14. **Mobile app** — Not now. Keep web-only but ensure mobile accessibility. **Action:** Audit responsive breakpoints, tap targets (min 44px), and touch gestures across all pages. The homepage and dashboard already have responsive CSS — day flow and exercises need checking.

15. **Internationalization** — English only for now. Backburner. When ready: use `next-intl` or `next-i18next`. Main effort is extracting ~200 UI strings from inline text to translation files. Exercise content lives in the database and would need a `locale` column. **Effort:** ~1 week for UI, ongoing for content translation.

16. **A/B testing for pricing** — Statsig is a good choice — free tier covers early-stage, integrates with Next.js via `@statsig/js-client`, and supports feature flags + experiments. Alternative: PostHog (also free tier, more analytics-focused). Vercel also has built-in Edge Config for simple feature flags. **Recommendation:** Statsig for pricing experiments specifically — it has paywall-specific tooling and statistical rigor. ~2-3 hours to integrate.

17. **Content management (CMS)** — Currently all content is in `src/content/site.ts` (homepage), database (exercises, day content), and inline in page files. **Options:**
    - **Sanity.io** (recommended): Free tier, real-time preview, structured content. ~2-3 days to set up schema + migrate homepage/program content. Exercise content stays in Supabase.
    - **Contentlayer + MDX**: No external service, content lives in repo as markdown. Simpler but no visual editor. ~1 day.
    - **Keep as-is**: If content changes are infrequent and you're comfortable editing `site.ts`, a CMS adds complexity without much benefit at this stage.

### Infrastructure (needs separate resources)
- [ ] **Staging environment** — develop branch exists with Vercel preview URLs. Needs separate Supabase project for full data isolation.

### Milestones to Watch
